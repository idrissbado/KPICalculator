# KPICalculator
KPICalculator  KPICalculator is a Python class designed for calculating various Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) from transaction and user data.

 The tool provides insights into transaction volume, user engagement, revenue, operational efficiency, customer experience, geographical trends, and product-specific metrics.  ## Features  - **Transaction KPIs**: Calculate total volume, value, average transaction value, growth rates, and more. - **User Engagement KPIs**: Analyze active users, retention rate, churn rate, and transaction frequency. - **Revenue KPIs**: Measure total revenue, revenue per transaction, revenue growth, and revenue per user. - **Operational Efficiency KPIs**: Evaluate error rates, fraud rates, cost per transaction, and dispute resolution times. - **Customer Experience KPIs**: Determine Net Promoter Score (NPS), customer satisfaction scores, and support response times. - **Geographical KPIs**: View transactions, user growth, and revenue per region. - **Product-Specific KPIs**: Assess feature usage rates and adoption of new features. - **Summary Report**: Generate a concise summary of all major KPIs.  
 ## Installation  
 1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
 2.  Install the required Python libraries using:
 3.   ```bash    pip install pandas
Usage
Load your dataset using pandas and ensure it has the relevant columns (e.g., transaction_id, amount, date, user_id, etc.).

Initialize the KPICalculator class with your DataFrame:

python

import pandas as pd
from kpi_calculator import KPICalculator

# Load your dataset
df = pd.read_csv("wave_data.csv")
df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'])  # Ensure the 'date' column is in datetime format

# Initialize the KPI Calculator
kpi_calculator = KPICalculator(df)
Use various methods to calculate KPIs:

python

total_transactions = kpi_calculator.total_transaction_volume()
print("Total Transactions:", total_transactions)
Generate a summary report:

python

report = kpi_calculator.summary_report()
print(report)
Prerequisites
Python 3.6 or later
